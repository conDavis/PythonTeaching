# PythonTeaching
My repository of Python Teaching Materials for Camp Connect.

This repository contains some of the teaching materials that I created to 
teach kids ages 10-14 about programming in Python. It includes an intro
to Python, an intro to lists, an intro to sorting algorithms, a practice
set for for-loops, and the starter code and some finished example code
for our final project.
