# Grocery list in Python:
food = [ "cereal", "milk", "digorno", "ice cream" ]

# How is it similar to our example?
# Has a title: 'groceries'
# Has a length of 4


# Accessing elements of a list: 0 based indexing
print(food[0])
print(food[1])
print(food[2])
print(food[3])

# How do we know how long the list is?
print(len(food))


# We can cross off, erase, and add things to our
# grocery list, how do we do it in Python


# Add an element to the end
food.append("chips")
print(food)

print(len(food))

# Remove an element
food.remove("chips")
print(food)

# Insert at index (tricky how it moves items)
food.insert(2, "chips")
print(food)
